# Numerical Integration Tool
**Will plot and integrate a function over the desired range, in addition to giving the point estimates and credible intervals**

Developed for the problems at [Probability and Statistics Problem Solve](https://probabilityandstatsproblemsolve.wordpress.com/2018/10/29/practice-problem-set-2-poisson-and-gamma/) <p>
    
Despite the ads, I find [Integral Calculator](https://www.integral-calculator.com), invaluable for an analytic solution, but sometimes this (where it exists) can be horrid - try the example below! <p>
    
So I wrote this - nothing grounbreaking, but it doesn't lock you into a single function - it's reusable with any function of your choice.
